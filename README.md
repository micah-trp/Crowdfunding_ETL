## Data Visualisation Monash Boot Camp. Crowdfunding_ETL Project 2 Group 10. 
### Contributors: Micah Raquena-Pequeno, Graham Meadon, Richard Soos

### Project Technology: This project is written in Python with Pandas extensions to receive xlsx data.
###                     The final data relationships have been shown in Postgres Database.

## Project Aim: To convert flat files from 2 xlsx data sheets into a relational database using ETL techniques.

## Project Concept: 
### Crowdfunding data has been supplied,  listed by company, with their support backers,
### contributions towards financial goal, dates of campaign start and close and campaign status. A further 
### contacts data sheet was supplied of business/campaign owner. The data is not normalised as so far the 
### categories are by category_id/subcategory_id. By creating an index for each unique category_id  and 
### seperately for each subcategory_id we could split these values into seperate dataframes in preperation for
### exporting csv files for loading into Postgres tables as a relational database.
### The resultant database is easier to query the fortune of crowdfunding campaigns by business category or 
### business subcategory.

## Key Files
### - ELT_Mini_Project_MRaquenaPequeno.ipynb
### - Resources Folde:
 ### - 

## To run the code:  
### The directory structure in git hub has all files in their appropriate place.
### The starter Jupyter file may be run in Visual Studio. Set the local directory in Visual Studio to that file 
### location and you will be able to rerun this project.
### The Source file folder has a subfolder Resources. It contains the contacts and crowdfunding Microsoft Excel 
### Workbook flat files. All outputs from the Jupyter Source file will be created in the same subfolder, 
### though as .csv files.
### These export .csv files may be used to load into a database. The Resources subfolder contains a file
### crowdfunding_db_schema.sql to create table structures before loading.

# Data Visualisation Monash Boot Camp. Crowdfunding_ETL Project 2 Group 10. 
# Contributors: Micah Raquena, Graham Meadon, Richard Soos
# Project Technology: This project is written in Python with Pandas extensions to receive xlsx data.
#                     The final data relationships have been shown in Postgres Database.
# Project Aim: To convert flat files from 2 xlsx data sheets into a relational database using ETL techniques.
# Project Concept: Crowdfunding data has been supplied,  listed by company, with their support backers,
# contributions towards financial goal, dates of campaign start and close and campaign status. A further 
# contacts data sheet was supplied of business/campaign owner. The data is not normalised as so far the 
# categories are by category_id/subcategory_id. By creating an index for each unique category_id  and 
# seperately for each subcategory_id we could split these values into seperate dataframes in preperation for
# exporting csv files for loading into Postgres tables as a relational database.
# The resultant database is easier to query the fortune of crowdfunding campaigns by business category or 
# business subcategory.
#
# To run the code:  The directory structure in git hub has all files in their appropriate place.
# The starter Jupyter file may be run in Visual Studio. Set the local directory in Visual Studio to that file 
# location and you will be able to rerun this project.
# The Source file folder has a subfolder Resources. It contains the contacts and crowdfunding Microsoft Excel 
# Workbook flat files. All outputs from the Jupyter Source file will be created in the same subfolder, 
# though as .csv files.
# These export .csv files may be used to load into a database. The Resources subfolder contains a file
# crowdfunding_db_schema.sql to create table structures before loading.
#
# The relational database diagram has been created with https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/
